# James Stott's React Profile

## Description

This is my latest Portfolio creation. It was created using React, Bootstrap and Framer Motion and boasts a responsive and colorful design to create interest and making navigating through my gallery of development accomplishments a delight! This single page application runs smoothly, with tasteful animations and interactivity sprinkled through to demonstrate some of the wonders of web development using these modern technologies.
